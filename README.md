I enjoy working with c#, Java, and pretty much anything but Python. 
Please do not make me use Python.
Please.

I am currently working on a game called Skyhold. You can playtest it and provide feedback <a href = "sites.google.com/view/grahams-epic-games/skyhold">here</a>.
Also currently getting better at c++ for use with arduino and similar systems.
