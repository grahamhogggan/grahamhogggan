I enjoy working with c#, Java, and pretty much anything but Python. 
Please do not make me use Python.
Please.

I work on software for FRC team 7230
I recently made a game called Skyhold. You can playtest it and provide feedback <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/grahams-epic-games/skyhold">here</a>.  
My current project is a rocket flight game where you can program the rocket using a custom language.  
Also currently learning:  
  c++ for arduino/raspberry pi/similar systems  
  WinUI3 and developing Windows Apps
